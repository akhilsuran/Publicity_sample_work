Product Catalog 
Develop a product catalog using Vue.js. 
Create components for: 

1. ProductList Component: Display a list of products with their names, prices, and a
button to view details. 

2. ProductDetails Component: Show detailed information about a selected product,
including its description, specifications, and price. 

Implement routing using Vue Router: 
- Route 1: `/products` - Display the `ProductList` component. 
- Route 2: `/products/:id` - Show the `ProductDetails` component, where `:id` is the
product ID.
